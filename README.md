AUTOMATED RESUME GRADER


The Automated Resume Grader is a web-based tool that helps job-seekers instantly evaluate their resumes. Users can upload a PDF resume, and the system analyzes it for key elements like contact information, education, skills, experience, and formatting. Based on these checks, it generates a score out of 100, along with actionable feedback on how to improve.
For example, if the resume is missing a skills section or uses poor formatting, the grader highlights that and suggests improvements â€” such as adding bullet points, listing relevant technologies, or making section titles clearer.


I built this project using Python and Flask, with pdfplumber for PDF.  The interface is simple, ensuring anyone can use it without technical knowledge.
